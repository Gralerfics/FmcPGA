MIG ouputs files (sim.do and other files) required to run the simulations for
Modelsim, ISIM and Vivado Simulator simulator.

1. How to run simulations in Modelsim simulator

   A) sim.do File :

      a) The 'sim.do' file has commands to compile and simulate memory
         interface design and run the simulation for specified period of time.

      b) It has the syntax to Map the required libraries (unisims_ver,
         unisim and secureip). The libraries should be mapped using
         the following command
         vmap unisims_ver <unisims_ver lib path>
         vmap unisim <unisim lib path>
         vmap secureip  <secureip lib path>

         Also, $XILINX environment variable must be set in order to compile glbl.v file

      c) Displays the waveforms that are listed with "add wave" command.

   B) Steps to run the Modelsim simulation:

      a) The user should invoke the Modelsim simulator GUI.

      b) Change the present working directory path to the sim folder.
         In Transcript window, at Modelsim prompt, type the following command to
         change directory path.
            cd <sim directory path>

      c) Run the simulation using sim.do file.
         At Modelsim prompt, type the following command:
            do sim.do

      d) To exit simulation, type the following command at Modelsim prompt:
            quit -f

      e) Verify the transcript file for the memory transactions.

2. How to run simualtions in ISIM (Xilinx simulator) simulator

   A) Following files are provided :

      a) The "isim_files.prj" file contains the list of the hdl files
         present in the design. It also contains the hdl, library and
         the source file names.

      b) The "isim_options.tcl" file contains the TCL commands for simulation
         and resume on error.

      c) The "isim_run.bat" has commands which use "isim_files.prj" and
         "isim_options.tcl" files.

   B) Steps to run the ISIM simulation:

      The user should execute the file isim.bat, which does the following steps:
      a) Compiles, elaborates the design and generates the simulation executable
         using the fuse command in 'isim.bat' file.

      b) Invokes the ISIM GUI.

      c) User can add required signals from objects window to the waveform viewer
         and run simulation for specified time using the command
         "run <time>" in ISIM GUI.

3. How to run simualtions in Vivado Simulator

   A) Following files are provided :

      a) The "xsim_files.prj" file contains the list of the hdl files
         present in the design. It also contains the hdl, library and
         the source file names.

      b) The "xsim_options.tcl" file contains the TCL commands for simulation
         and resume on error.

      c) The "xsim_run.sh/xsim_run.bat" has commands which use "xsim_files.prj" and
         "xsim_options.tcl" files.

   B) Steps to run the simulations with Vivado Simulator:

      The user should execute the file xsim_run.sh/xsim_run.bat, which does the 
      following steps:
      a) Compiles, elaborates the design and generates the simulation executable
         using the fuse command in "xsim_run.sh/xsim_run.bat" file.

      b) Invokes the Vivado Simulator GUI.

      c) User can add required signals from objects window to the waveform viewer
         and run simulation for specified time using the command
         "run <time>" in Vivado Simulator GUI.

4. SIM_BYPASS_INIT_CAL parameter value of SKIP, skips memory initialization sequence
   and calibration sequence. This could lead to simulation errors since design is not
   calibrated at all. Preferred values for parameter SIM_BYPASS_INIT_CAL to run
   simulations are FAST and OFF.

6. VHDL designs cannot be simulated with ISIM due to a simulator library issue.
